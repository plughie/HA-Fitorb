# Fitorb Smart Ring for Home Assistant

Custom Home Assistant integration for Fitorb smart rings that appear compatible with the Colmi R02-R06 BLE protocol.

## Scope

The integration exposes current values as Home Assistant entities:

- Battery level
- Charging state
- Steps today
- Calories today
- Distance today
- Heart rate
- SpO2
- Stress
- Last successful update
- Connection state

Version 2 adds an experimental direct BLE history sync. It reads cached ring data
when the ring returns to Home Assistant Bluetooth range, deduplicates samples
locally, and exposes diagnostics so the real retention window can be measured on
your ring firmware. It also exposes the latest parsed sleep start/end and stage
durations.

## Bluetooth Requirements

Home Assistant must be able to make active BLE GATT connections to the ring. A Shelly Bluetooth proxy is not enough for this integration because Shelly devices forward advertisements but do not proxy active GATT connections.

For Home Assistant in Proxmox:

1. Plug a supported USB Bluetooth adapter into the Proxmox host.
2. Pass the USB device through to the Home Assistant VM.
3. Restart the VM.
4. In Home Assistant, add or verify the Bluetooth integration.
5. Disconnect the ring from the phone app before first setup if the ring only accepts one active BLE connection.

## Historical Sync

Historical sync uses the same direct Bluetooth path as the live sensors plus the
Colmi Big Data service for sleep stages. The ring must come back into range of
the Home Assistant Bluetooth adapter or an active GATT-capable proxy before
cached samples can be recovered. The phone app and the Home Assistant mobile app
do not relay these BLE GATT reads.

The default lookback is 7 days with a 1 day overlap. The exact retention window is
firmware-dependent and not guaranteed by the public Colmi references. Use the
diagnostic sensors `Last history sync`, `History sample count`, `First history
sample`, and `Last history sample` to see what the ring actually returned.

The first history release stores and deduplicates parsed samples for validation
and exposes the latest parsed sleep summary as sensors. It does not write old
Home Assistant recorder state rows. Long-term statistics publishing will be
added after the packet timestamps and units are confirmed with real hardware
logs.

## Mobile Android Relay

The optional Android relay app is designed for multi-day travel where the ring
is not near Home Assistant Bluetooth. The app reads the ring on a configurable
schedule, stores samples locally, and uploads batches to Home Assistant over
your own HTTPS endpoint at `/api/fitorb/relay/v1/samples`.

Use the `fitorb.create_relay_token` service to create a relay-scoped token for
one Android device. Store that token in the relay app. The token is only valid
for Fitorb relay ingest and can be revoked with `fitorb.revoke_relay_token`.
Treat it as a bearer secret and send it only over HTTPS.

Manual verification:

```yaml
service: fitorb.create_relay_token
data:
  entry_id: "<real-config-entry-id>"
  label: "Pixel test"
```

The service response contains `token_id`, `token`, `entry_id`, and `label`.
The token begins with `fitorb_relay_`.

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod `
  -Method Post `
  -Uri "https://YOUR_HA_HOST/api/fitorb/relay/v1/samples" `
  -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer YOUR_RELAY_TOKEN" } `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body '{
    "relay_id":"manual-test",
    "ring_id":"AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
    "app_version":"0.1.0",
    "protocol_version":1,
    "sent_at":"2026-07-03T10:00:00Z",
    "samples":[
      {
        "sample_id":"manual-heart-1",
        "ring_id":"AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
        "metric":"heart_rate",
        "timestamp":"2026-07-03T09:55:00Z",
        "value":72,
        "unit":"bpm",
        "source":"android_relay",
        "captured_at":"2026-07-03T09:55:05Z",
        "protocol_version":1
      }
    ]
  }'
```

The first upload should return `manual-heart-1` in `accepted`. Running the same
request again should return `manual-heart-1` in `duplicates`.

Recommended defaults:

- Ring sync interval: 10 minutes.
- Scan window: 15-20 seconds.
- One retry per BLE cycle.
- Backoff after repeated failures up to 60 minutes.

The relay does not keep a permanent BLE connection to the ring. Upload retries
reuse locally queued samples and do not wake the ring again.

## Installation

Copy `custom_components/fitorb` into Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory or add `https://github.com/ichwars/HA-Fitorb` as a HACS custom repository.

Restart Home Assistant, then add **Fitorb Smart Ring** from **Settings > Devices & services**.

## Debug Logging

Add this to `configuration.yaml` when collecting logs:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.fitorb: debug
```

Debug logs may include raw BLE notification payloads in hexadecimal form.
History debug logs may include raw historical BLE packets. These are useful when
checking whether QRing sync changes what Home Assistant can later read.

Heart rate, SpO2, and stress reads are best-effort. Some Fitorb/Colmi-compatible
firmware versions do not answer the known live health commands, so the integration
uses a short optional timeout until a measurement starts, then waits longer for
the final value while keeping battery/activity values. Until the first live health
value is observed, Home Assistant retries health reads on every summary poll.
Debug logging shows raw health packets when the ring answers without an immediate
value; the integration keeps waiting for a later live value in the same poll.

## Troubleshooting

### `org.bluez.Error.InProgress` or `Failed to connect after 12 attempt(s)`

BlueZ is still busy with a BLE connection attempt, or the ring is already connected
to another central device. Close the phone app, disconnect the ring from the phone
Bluetooth settings if needed, wait 30-60 seconds, and reload the integration. If the
error persists, restart the Home Assistant Bluetooth adapter or the HA VM.

When Home Assistant has no connectable Bluetooth path to the ring during a poll, the
integration keeps the last known values and marks the connection unavailable until a
later poll reaches the ring again.

## Known Limits

- The phone app may need to be disconnected while Home Assistant polls the ring.
- Heart rate, SpO2, and stress may stay unknown until the live health command
  format for this ring firmware is confirmed.
- Calories and distance units should be verified against real ring data.
- Unknown BLE packets are logged for analysis and ignored by Version 1.
